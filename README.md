general
-------
source("file.r")

getwd()

?function_name shows docs

vectors atÃ²mics:
----------------
c is short for combine

foo = c(1,3,4,2,3,123,3,2,2)

parameters can be numeric, textual or boolean

operators repeat to match vector lengths e.g. c(1,2,3,4) + c(1,2) = c(2,4,4,6)
if repeated lengths do not match you'll get a warning but it does it anyway

ranges:
1:10
seq(1,10,2)
seq(0,1,length=10)

slicing
-------
foo = c('a','b','c','d','e')

positional
```r
foo[c(1,2)] -> ab
foo[c(-1,-2)] -> cde
foo[seq(1,4,2)] -> ac
```

logic
```r
foo[1:5 < 3] = ab
```

Label elements to access by name
x=1:12
names(x) = month.abb

then
x['Jan'] -> 1

lists
construct: foo = list(3)
slice: foo[1] -> dataframe-like  [[1]] [1] 3
get element: foo[[1]] -> 3

util functions
---------------

sapply(c(1,2), fib) : where fib is a function, applies function to each element
lapply -> list
mapply : zip with apply, coerced by min lenght

is.list()

```r
foo[['name']] is equivalent to foo$name
```
